Thank you for participating in this study. <br>
<br>
In this project we were interested in your personality traits and how you responded to some arithmetic tasks that require you to multiply numbers together. In particular, we were interested in whether different types of feedback would influence your responses to this task. Some of the feedback aimed to encourage a “growth” mindset – i.e. a strong sense that your arithmetic ability will improve if you work at it. Other feedback was designed to encourage a “fixed” mindset – i.e. a strong sense that your arithmetic ability is fixed and cannot improve. <br>
<br>
There is a lot of evidence that an individual’s ability can change drastically if they work at it, and <u><b>so it’s important that you know that any feedback you received during the experiment that suggested your ability is fixed and will not change is inaccurate.</b></u> We wanted to test whether these two types of feedback changed how many correct answers you got during the task, whether they changed your enjoyment of arithmetic and whether they changed your confidence in your ability to do arithmetic.
